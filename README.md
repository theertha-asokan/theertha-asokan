# Hello, World! 🌎

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Theertha Asokan, a passionate developer, Analyst, and occasional over-thinker. Here's a sneak peek into who I am:

### 👩‍💻 About Me
🔭 Exploring opportunities in tech and analysis.  
🏢 Currently working as an IT Business Analyst.  
🌱 Skilled in process mapping, data analysis, solution design, and Business Intelligence.  
💬 Let’s discuss how analysis drives better business decisions. 

### 🤓 Fun Facts
- 🎨 Can sketch better ideas than I can sketch drawings.
- 🎉 Known for breaking things (professionally(!only), of course) before fixing them.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python:** (maybe I’m toxic, that’s why I love Python)  
- **SQL:** (It obeys all the commands, satisfying my urge to be royal)  
- **Power BI:** (turning dull numbers into a visual masterpiece)  
- **Tableau:** (you know aaaart : for juswt to say yeah i kno tableau)  
- **API integration:** (I don’t like 3rd parties, haaah...., but sometimes they make life easier)  
- **Agile methodologies:** (because waterfalls are beautiful, but got no time to watch.)
